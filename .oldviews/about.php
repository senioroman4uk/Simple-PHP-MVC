            <td><p>During a discussion last week, Urmson said Google has internally developed
                    a set of lidar sensors that are smaller and more effective than current models.
                    The lidar sensors that Google buys from Silicon Valley technology firm Velodyne
                    cost about $75,000 apiece, but Urmson said Google's sensors should achieve
                    significant cost reduction.</p>
