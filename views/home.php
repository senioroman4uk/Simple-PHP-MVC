            <td>Google stunned the industry in 2009 by revealing its research into
                self-driving cars, which use sensors and software to guide them down
                the road while following laws, obeying traffic signals and avoiding
                obstacles such as cyclists and pedestrians.

            <td>Like autonomous vehicles being developed by automakers such as Mercedes-Benz
                and Nissan, Google's self-driving vehicle uses cameras, mid- and long-range radar
                and laser sensors known as lidar to watch the road.
